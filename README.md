# Pub Quiz Generator

As part of an application for a software development job, I was tasked with creating a pub quiz builder website/webapp.

## The webapp should allow the user to do the following:

1. Create a quiz.
2. Create questions and assign answers.
3. Edit questions.
4. Delete questions.
5. Arrange the order of the questions.
6. Play a quiz and see the results.

## The webapp should demonstrate the following skills:

1. HTML.
2. CSS.
3. JavaScript (optional jQuery).
4. MySQL or PHP for backend. -- I have opted to use Node.js and MongoDB for the back end.

## Deployment

I have deployed the completely function web application via Heroku and can be accessed [here](http://pub-quiz-builder.herokuapp.com/)

### Footnote

This is a refactored version of a previous repository (see [here](https://github.com/Ross-mc/pub-quiz-builder)).

This version has been designed as Node.js and Express.js full stack web application.
